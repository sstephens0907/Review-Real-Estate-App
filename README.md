# Review-Real-Estate-App
Real-estate listing websites bring exposure to home sellers and convenience to home buyers. They offer an easy way for sellers to advertise their properties and for buyers to compare many potential homes while shopping. Such a website functions as a central hub for all the properties in a particular geographical area that are for sale. Usually, it offers many ways for buyers to filter and sort the listings.

In this assignment, you and your small group will create a web app that starts with an empty array, which corresponds to an empty real-estate website. Then, you will complete the objectives described later on this page for an interactive web app.

GENERAL CODE
Success Metrics (Rubric)
- Feel free to write the code however you want—as long as your final product meets the following requirements.

General Code
- The real-estate app is written so that it manipulates an array of objects.
- The design choices are explained and documented in comments.
- DOM elements are styled via CSS.

ADDING AND REMOVING
- Users can add and remove objects from an array by creating input elements, entering data into those elements, and then clicking a button.
- The array is both responsive and accurately rendered in the browser window.
- Users can enter a street address, a property type (such as house, apartment, or loft), a city, and a state in input elements.
- Each rendered property should have a corresponding UI element that will remove it from the page.

NAVIGATION
- A navigation bar that spans the top of the web app and/or a footer across the bottom is added.
- The elements have links to other parts of the app, such as "About" and "Contact."
- The app can use dummy data or lorum ipsum text. Real information is not required.

COMMENTS
- Users can leave comments no longer than a tweet—that is, 280 characters—on any property they want.
- Users can select a Comment button that reveals a text input element. They can then enter their comment and select Send to add it to the property's object in the array.
- Data is stored either locally or in state memory. Neither a database nor persistence is required.
